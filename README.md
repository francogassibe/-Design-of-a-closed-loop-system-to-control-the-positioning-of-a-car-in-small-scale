# Control of car position


In this projet we implemented a position control of a litle car we also mecanicaly designed from scratch

The car has 2 CC motors driven by an H bridge Controled by an Arduino ONE 
the arduino get position values from an ultrasound sensor
the arduino code implements a PID controller to define an output value U


You can see the finished car working in the 'movie' video and in the 'Photo' image 
The arduino code is in the Franco file
